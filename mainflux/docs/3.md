## What are Things and Channels?

Things and Channels are the two main resources in Mainflux Things Service. Things are the devices that send data to Mainflux, and Channels are the endpoints that receive data from Things. Channels are also logical groups of Things.

## Creating Things

To create a new Thing, you need to provide a name. You can also add additional information. Once the Thing is created, you can connect it to a Channel.

```bash
mainflux-cli things create '{"name": "<thing_name>"}' <user_auth_token>
```

## Creating Channels

To create a new Channel, you need to provide a name and description. You can also add additional information. Once the Channel is created, you can connect Things to it.

```bash
mainflux-cli channels create '{"name": "<channel_name>", "description": "<channel_description>"}' <user_auth_token>
```

## Connecting Things to Channels

To connect a Thing to a Channel, you need to provide their IDs. Once the Thing is connected to the Channel, it will be able to send data to the Channel.

```bash
mainflux-cli things connect <thing_id> <channel_id> <user_auth_token>
```
