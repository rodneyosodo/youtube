## What are Users and Groups?

Users and Groups are the two main components of Mainflux. Users are the people who use Mainflux to manage their IoT devices, while Groups are the collections of users who share the same interests or work together on a project.

## Creating Users

To create a new user, you need to provide a username, password, and email address. You can also add additional information. Once the user is created, they can log in to Mainflux.

```bash
mainflux-cli users create <username> <email> <password>
```

## Creating Groups

To create a new group, you need to provide a name and description. You can also add additional information. Once the group is created, you can add users to it by assigning them to the group.

```bash
mainflux-cli groups create '{"name": "<group_name>", "description": "<group_description>"}' <user_auth_token>
```

## Adding Users to Groups

To add a user to a group, you need to provide their user ID. You can also specify the allowed actions for the user. Once the user is added to the group, they will be able to access the group's resources.

```bash
mainflux-cli groups assign <allowed_actions> <user_id> <group_id> <user_auth_token>
```
